ðŸ”­We are currently working on designing a web portal made for kids to complement a robotic car that will be created in ICT2104. 

<br>

ðŸ’¬The portal will include functionalities such as:
  - viewing the car status information (current & average speed, location etc.)
  - ability for the user to send direction commands to the car
  - storing a list of the car's past movements/commands (history)
  - simple and easy user flow for kids to use
 
<br>
 
 âš¡We will also strive for the following security measures:
  - to ensure that strangers are not allowed to control the car without permission
  - no conflicts if there are 2 or more robotic cars connected to the same WiFi 

<br>

* The project is coded using the Asp.NET Core Framework and hence require that an Visual Studio IDE either [Visual Studio Community 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) be used to build/run the project. 
* Do also ensure that with you have selected the '**ASP.NET and Web Development**' workload when installing the IDE.  

### Additional SDKs
The project is coded using the [.NET Core 3.1.415 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-3.1.415-windows-x64-installer) as it has Long Term Support(LTS) and require the [Asp.NET Core 3.1.21 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-aspnetcore-3.1.21-windows-x64-installer) to run the project.

# Building & Running the Project
1. Open the `CodeACar.sln` file with a Visual Studio IDE
2. Right-click the Project `CodeACar.sln` & Click `Build`

# Seed Data
To aid the testing of the system, we have seeded some data into the database for demostration purposes. The information of the seed data can be viewed in the [Wiki](https://github.com/cweiwenr/ICT2101-team-p3-3/wiki/Seed-Data).

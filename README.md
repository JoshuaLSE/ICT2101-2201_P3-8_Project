ðŸ”­We are currently working on designing a web portal made for kids to complement a robotic car that will be created in ICT2104. 

<br>

ðŸ’¬The portal will include functionalities such as:
  - viewing the car status information (current & average speed, location etc.)
  - ability for the user to send direction commands to the car
  - storing a list of the car's past movements/commands (history)
  - simple and easy user flow for kids to use
 
<br>
 
 âš¡We will also strive for the following security measures:
  - to ensure that strangers are not allowed to control the car without permission
  - no conflicts if there are 2 or more robotic cars connected to the same WiFi 

<br>
